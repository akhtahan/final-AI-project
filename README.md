# Final AI Project - Multiclass Classification with Pycaret of White Wine Quality
PyCaret is an open-source machine learning library that can be used for developing classification models. This project used PyCaret in JupyterNotebook to create a classification pipeline that predicts the quality of white wine based on various features. The process used the UCI Machine Learning Repository’s White Wine dataset with the target variable as the quality. The PyCaret classification setup was then initialized, followed by the comparison of multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing model for this task. The Random Forest Classifier was found to be the best-performing model and model analysis using a confusion matrix, AUC, and feature importance visualizations was done to visualize metrics. The model was then used to make predictions on the test set, and the predicted results were displayed. The model pipeline was also saved using PyCaret’s save_model functionality and subsequently loaded for future use, showcasing the ease of model deployment. This project highlights the power of PyCaret in automating model selection and evaluation, allowing efficient development of classification models with low code and minimal effort.
